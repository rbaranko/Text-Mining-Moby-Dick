# Text-Mining-Moby-Dick

This project takes the raw text of the book, "Moby Dick", and runs various data exploration queries to find quantifiable insigts on the text.  This project leans on the NILTK library, including word tokenization/lemmatizing, bag-of-words, word vectorization, and part-of-speech tagging.  Part-of-speech tagging legend can be found here: https://www.guru99.com/pos-tagging-chunking-nltk.html
